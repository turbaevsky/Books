\subsection{Grid-Related Loss Factor (GRLF)}

\subsubsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this indicator is to monitor industry progress in
minimising power reductions that result from grid instability or loss
of the electrical grid from causes not under plant management
control. This indicator reflects the effect of grid instability or
loss of grid on unit generation. Grid reliability issues can
eventually lead to challenges to plant safety systems.

\subsubsection{Definition}

The grid-related loss factor (GRLF) is defined as the ratio of energy
losses due to grid instability or a loss of electrical grid due to
causes not under plant management control during a given period of
time, to the reference energy generation, during the same period,
expressed as a percentage. 

The generation losses are those that result from grid instability or a
loss of the grid that are otherwise not reportable as planned or
unplanned generation losses. Energy losses may be automatic, directed
by a grid dispatcher due to grid problems, or manually controlled; but
never due to causes under the control of plant management.

\subsubsection{Calculations}

The grid-related loss factor is calculated for a period as shown below.
$$ Value for a unit (\%) = \frac{GRL}{REG} \cdot 100 $$		 
Where	

GRL = energy losses due to grid instability or loss of grid 

REG = reference energy generation 
$$ Value for the industry = median of the unit values $$
