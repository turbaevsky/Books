\subsubsection{Intoduction}

This moment (\today) PI Report system has all the precalculated
PI results excepting TISA but cannot create the most important reports
like Long-term Targets, Trifold (annual summary), spreadsheets etc.

Currentrly all the extra reports are provided locally by London
office.

LO has a plan to integrate all te necessary reports into updated PI
Report system, but is seems available only after 2020.

This moment all the extra reports might be requested by members and RC
to WANO LO.

When all the source data has been received from RCs the PI System
Administrator (SA) should initiate calculation (using Maintenance tab in
the PI Report system) then release results using the same tab there.

From this time the system will update (if any) and publish the updated
results automatically every weekend. The SA also can initiate the
updating process manually at any time.

Members and RCs have not any limitation to chenge their source data at
any time for any period of time.
